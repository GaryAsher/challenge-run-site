# CRC Game Request Form - Field Documentation

This document explains the purpose of each field in the game request form and how the data will be used.

---

## Field Purposes

### 1. Game Name (Required)
**Purpose:** Identify the game being requested.  
**Usage:** 
- Track which games have the most requests
- Prevent duplicate entries
- Research the game's challenge run potential

**Why Required:** Without this, we can't process the request.

---

### 2. Platform(s)
**Purpose:** Understand where the game is played.  
**Usage:**
- Some games have platform-specific rules or limitations
- Helps identify if platform affects challenge viability
- Informs documentation about version differences

**Why Optional:** We can research this ourselves, but user input saves time.

---

### 3. Challenge Types
**Purpose:** Understand what the community wants to track.  
**Usage:**
- Prioritize games that fit CRC's challenge types
- Identify if new challenge categories are needed
- Guide initial rule creation

**Why Optional:** Lets users express interest without requiring expertise. We can determine viable challenges during review.

### 4. Existing Communities
**Purpose:** Gauge current community interest and infrastructure.  
**Usage:**
- Games with active communities are prioritized
- Helps identify potential collaborators/moderators
- Indicates established rulesets we can reference

**Why Important:** Community support is crucial for long-term success. A game with no community may not have enough interest.

---

### 5. Links to Communities
**Purpose:** Connect with existing communities.  
**Usage:**
- Research existing rules and conventions
- Reach out for collaboration
- Import existing runs/records with permission

**Why Optional:** Not all users know these links, and we can research ourselves.

---

### 6. Why Should This Game Be Added?
**Purpose:** Understand user motivation and game qualities.  
**Usage:**
- Identify unique aspects that make the game suitable
- Understand what users value
- Marketing material for when we add the game

**Why Optional:** Enthusiasm is great but not required. Some users just want to submit a name.

---

### 7. Discord Username
**Purpose:** Follow-up communication.  
**Usage:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Notify when the game is added
- Invite to help with initial setup

**Why Optional:** Privacy-respecting. Some users prefer anonymity.

---

### 8. Email
**Purpose:** Alternative contact method.  
**Usage:**
- Updates on request status
- Newsletter about new games (with consent)

**Why Optional:** Many prefer Discord. We respect privacy preferences.

## Prioritization Criteria

When reviewing requests, we consider:

1. **Request Volume** - More requests = higher priority
2. **Community Existence** - Active communities indicate sustained interest
3. **Challenge Viability** - Game mechanics must support meaningful challenges
4. **Documentation Availability** - Existing resources make setup easier
5. **CRC Capacity** - We need moderators/experts for each game

---

## Future Improvements

Consider adding these fields later as CRC grows:

- **Volunteer Interest:** "Would you help moderate this game?"
- **Run Submission:** "Do you have runs to submit immediately?"
- **Rule Suggestions:** "Any specific rules you'd recommend?"

Keep the initial form simple to maximize submissions. Add complexity only when needed.
