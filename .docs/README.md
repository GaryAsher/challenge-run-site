# ChallengeRuns Repository

This repository powers the ChallengeRuns site.

Most contributors only need to work in a small part of the repo.
If you are unsure where to make changes, start here.

## Where to make changes

Common tasks:

- Add or edit a game  
  → `_games/`

- Update tags or challenges  
  → `_data/tags.yml`  
  → `_data/challenges.yml`

- Work on site layout or styling  
  → `assets/`  
  → `_layouts/`

- Documentation and guides  
  → `.docs/`

## Generated and protected files

Some files are generated automatically and should not be edited by hand:

- `.github/CODEOWNERS`  
  (generated by `scripts/generate-codeowners.js`)

Changes to these files are enforced by CI.

## Guides

- How to add content and follow required steps  
  → `.docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`

- Common errors and fixes (CI, validation, Windows issues)  
  → `.docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (if present)

## Not sure where something belongs?

If you’re unsure:
- check `.docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- or ask before making changes

Automation and validation are in place to prevent mistakes, but this README should help you avoid them in the first place.
