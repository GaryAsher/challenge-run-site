**Internal Document — Not Public-Facing**
Last updated: February 11, 2026

## Your Role

As a Verifier, you review pending run submissions for your assigned games and approve or reject them based on game rules and evidence quality. You have the most limited data access of any staff role.

---

## What You Can Access

- Pending runs for your assigned games
- Submitter's public profile information (display name, runner ID)

## What You Cannot Do

- Suspend or ban users
- Edit user profiles
- Delete any data
- Access pending profiles, user reports, or audit logs

---

## Run Verification

1. Review the submission against the game's rules and category requirements
2. Check video proof for validity (unedited, continuous footage, correct category)
3. Approve or reject the run
4. **Always provide a reason when rejecting** — keep it factual and professional
5. If the runner disputes a rejection, direct them to the [Support Page](/support/) for appeals
6. Do not engage in arguments about verification decisions
