## What You Can Access

- Pending runs and pending profiles for your assigned games
- User reports for your assigned games
- Submitter profile information (public info)

## What You Cannot Do

- Delete any user data — always escalate to an Admin
- Issue permanent bans — escalate to an Admin
- Access audit logs or financials
- Modify moderator assignments

## Handling User Data Requests

Users have a legal right to request access, correction, or deletion of their data. **You are not responsible for fulfilling these requests.** Your job is to route them correctly.

If a user asks you to delete their data, remove their profile, or export their information — in a DM, on Discord, on the site, or anywhere else:

1. Acknowledge the request politely
2. Direct them to email **privacy@challengerun.net**
3. Notify an Admin that a request came in
4. **Do NOT delete, edit, or compile data yourself**

This process exists to protect both the user and you. Deletion is irreversible and has legal implications — handling it without a documented process can result in problems even when your intentions are good.

---

## Content Removal

When removing user content (runs, profile elements, comments):

1. Document the reason for removal
2. The system logs the action automatically
3. Where possible, notify the user of the removal and the reason
4. For borderline cases, consult with another Moderator or Admin before acting

---

## Account Suspension

You can issue **temporary suspensions** for clear guideline violations:

1. Document the reason clearly
2. Always log the action
3. For **permanent bans**, escalate to an Admin for approval — do not issue them yourself

**Never delete user data as a disciplinary action.** Data deletion is a separate process governed by privacy law, not a punishment tool.

---

## Run Verification

1. Review submissions against game rules and category requirements
2. Approve or reject based on evidence provided
3. **Always provide a reason when rejecting**
4. If a runner disputes it, direct them to the [Support Page](/support/)
5. Do not engage in arguments — keep communication factual and professional

## When a User Asks You Something

| User Request | Your Action |
|---|---|
| "Delete my account / runs / profile" | Direct to privacy@challengerun.net. Notify an Admin. |
| "Give me a copy of my data" | Direct to privacy@challengerun.net |
| "Fix my profile info" | If they can self-edit, direct to account settings. Otherwise, forward to an Admin. |
| "Someone stole my content" | Escalate to an Admin — potential DMCA issue |
| "I want to appeal my ban" | Direct to the Support Page |
| "I'm under 13/16" | Escalate to an Admin immediately |
| "Another user is harassing me" | Document the report, take moderation action if warranted |

---

## General Rules

- **Only access data needed for your current task** — do not browse user data
- **Do not share user data** with anyone outside the staff team
- **Do not discuss** specific user data or moderation cases publicly (Discord, streams, social media)
- **Do not use your role** for queue priority, preferential treatment, or personal advantage
- **Log your actions** — if the system doesn't log it automatically, document what you did and why
- **If you discover or suspect a data breach**, notify an Admin IMMEDIATELY — do not attempt to fix it, and do not disclose it publicly until Admins have assessed

**When in doubt, escalate to an Admin.**
