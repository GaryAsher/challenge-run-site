      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Website is not intended for children under <strong>13 years of age</strong> (or under 16 in jurisdictions where GDPR sets a higher age of consent). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under these ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@challengerun.net">privacy@challengerun.net</a>, and we will promptly delete such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users between 13 and 18 years of age (or the age of majority in their jurisdiction) should have parental or guardian consent before creating an account.

    <section id="security">
      <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of all data in transit (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
        <li>Secure authentication via OAuth providers (no passwords stored by CRC)</li>

        <li>Regular security reviews</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

    <section id="international">
      <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        CRC is operated from the United States. Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States and other locations where our service providers operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our service providers (Supabase, Cloudflare, GitHub) may process data in the United States and at data centers globally. Where data is transferred outside the EEA/UK, our providers rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the Website, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to countries that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.

    <section id="do-not-track">
      <h2>13. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
      <p>
        Some web browsers transmit "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals to websites. There is currently no universally accepted standard for how websites should respond to DNT signals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Website does not currently alter its behavior in response to DNT signals. However, our analytics service (Cloudflare Web Analytics) is already privacy-focused: it does not track individual users across sites, does not use persistent cookies, and does not collect personally identifiable information. Additionally, analytics are only loaded after you give consent via our cookie banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to prevent all analytics data collection, you can reject analytics cookies using our <a href="#" id="privacy-dnt-cookie-settings">Cookie Settings</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        For significant changes (such as new categories of data collection or new third-party services), we will provide a prominent notice on the Website. If we materially change how we use personal data already collected, we will seek your consent where required by applicable law.
