Welcome to my profile! I'm a challenge runner who specializes in no-hit and hitless runs.

## My Challenge Run Journey

I started doing challenge runs in 2024 after watching some incredible no-hit runs on YouTube. Since then, I've been grinding Hollow Knight and Hades 2.

## Current Goals

- Complete a deathless Hades 2 Surface run
- Finish my first Hollow Knight Pantheon 5 hitless

Feel free to drop by my stream if you want to watch me attempt (and fail) these challenges!
