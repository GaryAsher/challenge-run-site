# Banned Terms Configuration
# Used by scripts/check-banned-terms.js during validation
#
# Supports two matching modes:
#   1. Simple strings (case-insensitive substring match)
#   2. Regex patterns (for partial matching and variations)
#
# IMPORTANT: This file contains partial patterns for slurs.
# These patterns are necessary to catch variations and obfuscations.

# ============================================================
# SLUR PATTERNS (regex-based for catching variations)
# ============================================================
# These use regex to catch the slur even when embedded in other text
# or with character substitutions.
#
# Format: Regex patterns that will be compiled with 'gi' flags
# Catches: embedded text, leetspeak, asterisk censoring

slur_patterns:
  # N-word pattern
  - "n[i1!][gq]{2}[e3a]r"
  
  # F-slur pattern
  - "f[a@4][gq]{2}[o0][t7]"
  
  # R-word pattern
  - "r[e3][t7][a@4]rd"
